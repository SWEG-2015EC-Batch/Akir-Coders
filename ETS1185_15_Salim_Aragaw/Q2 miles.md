problem analysis

input(s): the capacity of the fuel tank in gallons(capacity) and the miles per gallon that the automobile can be driven(milesPerGallons).
output(s): the number of mile that the automobile can be driven without refueling(miles).
procedure(s): 
--> variable declartion -> that holds an input and operation results 
--> read the capacity and the amount of miles per gallon that the automobile can be driven
--> calculating the number of miles using the formula and perform the operation
--> miles = capacity * milesPerGallon
--> displaying the number of mile that the automobile can be driven without refueling
         
algorithm/psedocode

step 1: start
step 2: read the capacity and milesPerGallon of the automobile
step 3: miles -->capacity * milesPerGallon
step 4: print miles
step 5: stop

problem analysis

input(s): the base and exponent of the function.
output(s): x raise to the power of y(x^y).
procedure(s):
--> variable declartion -> that holds an input and operation results 
--> read the base and set it to x
--> read the exponent and set it to y
--> calculate x^y using the cmath library
--> displaying the x^y

algorithm/psedocode

step 1: start
step 2: read the base(x) and the exponent(y) 
step 3: result --> x^y
step 4: print result
step 5: stop

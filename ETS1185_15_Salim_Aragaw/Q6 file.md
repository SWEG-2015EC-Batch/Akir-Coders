problem analysis

input:transmission rate,file size in bytes
output: time in second,minute,hours and days
procedure : 
--> reading the value of transmission rate and the amount of file size in bytes 
--> calculating the time in second by performing operation
--> converting the time in second to minute,hour and days
--> printing the time in second,minute,hour and days 

algorithm in psedocode

step 1: start 
step 2: intialize transmission rate <- 960 
step 3: read file size 
step 4: calculate time in seconds <- file size / transmission rate 
step 5: calculate days <- time in seconds /86400 step 
6: print days 
step 7: end
